It was created for the SEEED XIAO keyboard contest.

## CREDITS

### INSPIRATION

I've added the additional pinky key to make the TOTEM compatible with the layout boards like the [Balbuzard](https://github.com/brow/balbuzard) by [Tom Brow](https://github.com/brow) and the [Osprette](https://github.com/smores56/osprette) by [Sam Mohr](https://github.com/smores56) uses, where you put the keybinding of the top left and right keys on an outer pinky key.
