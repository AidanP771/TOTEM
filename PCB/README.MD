# TOTEM PCB FILES

## MANUFACTURING
If you want to get the PCB made you need to download the [ZIP](/PCB/totem1_3/totem_1-3_gerbers.zip/) and upload it to the website of the manufacture 
I can recommend [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), [Seeed Fusion](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html) or [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/).
If you want the silkscreen in yellow [AllPCB](https://www.allpcb.com/online_pcb_quote_new.html) is a pretty affordable choice.

- download [the ZIP file](/PCB/klor1_3/KLOR_1-3_gerbers.zip/)
- upload the ZIP file to the website of the manufacturer.
- sometimes the Gerber preview from JLCPCB can't display the PCB, even when the files are fine. In this case use this dimensions: 258.7mm * 94.35mm
- PCB Thickness 1.6mm
- 2 layers
- PCB Qty as much as you like. One PCB is a full keyboard.
- PCB Color Black (or any other color you like)
- No impedance control
- Surface Finish HASL(with lead) if you want the easiest soldering experience or LeadFree HASL.
- Remove Order Number Yes
